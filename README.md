# iris_project
In this project i have loaded the dataset from the seaborn library and then found the correlation between its different species. 
After that i have performed different ml algos over them to check which algo gives the maximum accuracy.
Result: Logistic Regression provided us better results compared to Decision Trees and Random Forest Trees.
